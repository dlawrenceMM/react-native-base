## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This project was built upon the [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) by [Kerem Ã‡ubuk](https://twitter.com/mxstbr).

While creating this project, I always need to a react-native standart for our team. When we start to new project, we always spend too much time. So that, we created [`react-native-boilerplate`](https://reactnativeboilerplate.dev/) and we wanted to share with the community.
