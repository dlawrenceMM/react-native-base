## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This project was built upon the [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

<b>IOS</b>:

```command
npx pod-install # to install pod dependencies
npm run ios     # to run the iOS application
```

```command
# Make sure the ANDROID_HOME environment variable is configured properly

npm run android # to run the Android application
```

## WSL2 Issues
On Windows:
```command
adb tcpip 5555
```

Then on WSL 2:
```command
adb connect [ip device]:5555
```

If it's the first time, it's going to ask you for permission in your phone, make sure to check the box to always grant permission. Then restart adb and connect again:
```command
adb kill-server
adb connect [ip device]:5555
```
